== Productivity of crops == 

Every crop (rice, wheat, soybean, ...) around the world became >2x more productive in the last 50 years. 
Yields increased x-fold while farmland only increased relatively little (by 10% compared to 50 years ago).
The increase in yield while holding farmland constant is the result of 3 factors: 
 
  (1) we feed plants better now then we did then (we feed them by adding fertilizer to the soil)
  (2) we protect them better (we protect them from bacteria, fungi, animals, weed by adding "pesticides")
  (3) we have improved the plants themselves (we use selective breeding or genetic engineering to have the most productive plants)

We are already eating (indirectly) genetically modified food.


== Farming == 

Every plant needs water and nutrients to survive and grow.
It gets those from only one place: the soil beneath it.
In monoculture farming, the soil is forced to be the perfect environment for monoculture growth.
This is achieved by adding nutrients in the form of fertilizers, and water by way of irrigation.

> "Because farm fields are loaded with nutrients and water relative to the natural land that surrounds them, they are coveted as luxury real estate by every random weed in the county. In addition, the fields that were plowed for planting were already home to innumerable insects, fungi, and bacteria that are only too eager to eat key parts of our crop plants before we can. To control these pests, farmers use "pesticides", chemicals that are poisonous to the weeds, insects, and microorganisms that would otherwise compromise the monoculture."


== DNA == 

DNA is like MORSE CODE.

MORSE CODE has a vocabulary of two tokens: dots and lines. 
Using combinations of dots and lines, we can code a simple "SOS" or the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy.

DNA has a vocabulary of 4 tokens, the nucleotides A, C, T, G.
DNA is a sequence of GENES.
A GENE is a combination of A,C,T,G that describes how to make a protein. 
A GENE is a recipe of how to make a protein. 
Every PROTEIN is capable of doing a job.
Thus DNA is like a long recipe book, where each recipe describes how to make a protein.

DNA = a sequence of genes
Gene = a recipe for a protein, written in the language of "ACTG"
Protein = something that is capable of doing a job
genetically modified organisms (GMOs) = organisms whose DNA was modified. Maybe a gene was deleted, or a new gene added.

> "biological DNA codes not for words but for proteins. DNA is one long recipe book. We refer to the individual recipes as "genes": A sub-chain of links that describes how to make a useful protein. Every gene is a recipe for a protein, and every protein is capable of doing a job"

> "In the 1980s, [scientists] perfected a method to alter DNA - a method that didn't require the hassle of breeding parents and waiting for a new generation to mature. These 'recombinant' strategies allowed genetics to directly edit the sequence of links in DNA: they could *delete*, *copy*, and *paste* genes, all within a living plant. They could even take genes from nonplant DNA and insert them into plant DNA, infusing a baby plant with recipes for proteins that it would never have figured out how to make otherwise."
