* "there is no such thing as an electric car"
* an electric car today is a x% fossil fuel car because x% of electricity is generated with fossil fuels.
* battery capacity reduced in cold/warm climate

Vaclav Smil, Should we be eating meat?, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAdX3MfD8OA
* 25%-45% of grown food is wasted
* 85% of world's people are well-fed 
* we're better in terms of (1) environment (2) animal welfare (3) health if we wouldn't eat meat ~80-100 kg per year

Vaclav Smil, Interview, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sac18hUuI4
* "I'm a scientist, I question everything you tell me... But North America runs on belief now." 
* "What Denmark could do, Japan could never do" -- speaking about compensating a calm, cloudy day. Norway has access to its neighbors' electricity coming from non-renewable sources (nuclear, coal). Japan hasn't. Hence for Japan it is not really an option to produce the majority of its power using renewable sources (wind, solar).
* To build a wind turbine, you need fossil fuels (for cement, steel, diesel fuel for the trucks and machinery required to build the turbine, ...). And what you get out of a wind turbine is electricity. But you cannot use this electrictiy to build another wind turbine. So building renewable electricity generating sources (wind, solar) requires fossil fuels!
* globally we eat 300 tonnes of meat per year
* "buildings are the longest lasting structures which waste energy on a grand scale" -- we need properly insulated walls & windows. Buildings last 50-100 years. Every building built now should have proper insulation as it pays off in the long-term. During the economic boom of China in the 2000s, the country has quickly built thousands of new buildings -- yet there were built without proper insulation. Smil calls this "the greates missed opportunity ever". And additional insulation doesn't even cost that much, it may add 5-15% costs, yet the long-term environmental and economical (!) benefits are huge.
* energy density = "we will never fly with electricity". We would need batteries to behave like Kerosine. Which will not happen in a long time or never.
