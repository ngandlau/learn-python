  - getting the externals right: taste, texture, appearance
  - getting the internals right: functionality, ingredients, nutritional quality
  - livestock production leads to greater pollution, land use, water use, greenhouse gas production (Willet, 2019)
  - region-specific: region bad for crops, but possible to rear livestock for food (e.g. rocky hills)
  - in all food categories, plant-based food demand grew 29% from 2017 to 2019, reaching $5bn market
  - plant-based market predicted to reach $35bn by 2024
    - the paper is from 2021. today's market size is $45bn. market grew faster than predicted.
    - expected to grow further.
    - high investment potential
  - plant-based market share:
      milk: 40% -- 40% of milk sold is plant-based ?? ??
      meat: 19%
      creamer: 5%
      yogurt: 5%
      butter: 4%
      cheese: 3%
  - milk
    - milk fat globules
    - casein micells
    - 87% water, 4-5% lactose, 3-4% fat, 3% protein, 0.8%minerals, 0.1% vitamins (Pereira, 2014) 
    - "the presence of milk fat globules & casein micelles plays a critical role in determining the physicochemical and functional properties of cow's milk" 
    - health benefits of cow's milk:
      - "diverse range of fats, proteins, carohydrates, vitamins, minerals" (Chalupa-Krebzdak, Long & Bohrer, 2018)

Nutrient density & nutritional value of milk and plant-based milk alternatives

- TLDR: milk provides a mix of nutrients (+good bioavailability of those nutrients). if you reduce milk, you have to compensate the loss of nutrients with other foods like greens (spinach, broccoli, kale). Replacing it with plant-based milk + calcium additives is not enough, because dairy milk contains more than just calcium.
- plant-based alternatives are not nutritionally equivalent -- all else equal, you are worse off in terms of nutrients (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, protein). => you need to compensate.
- dairy milk is produced by mammal's to nourish the young after birth. it's made to provide nutrients required to support growth & development of newborn mammals
- some things in milk, like Lactose, enhance the bioavailability of calcium in other minerals. That's important, because nutrients do not equal nutrients. The bioavailability of nutrients is important. And that can range widely, e.g. bioavailability of calcium ranges from 5% in spinach to 50% in broccoli. In other words, replacing the intake of 10mg calcium from milk is not necessarily equal to intake of 10mg calcium from spinach because milk has things in it that enhance the bioavailability of calcium, i.e. how much of it we can actually utilize.
- Casein proteins slow digestion, to give more time to "efficiently digest the nutrients in milk"
- milk consumption in Canada:
  - 89L milk per person in 1997 (Canada)
  - 69L milk per person in 2006 (Canada)
- some studies find health affects (primarily on children) if you subsidy milk with plant-based alternatives:
    - effect on growth of children (0.4cm less height for each glass of plant-based milk) -- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522025709
    - i only see effects reported on pre-teen children. do adults need milk?
- milk helps to meet daily recommended nutrient goals (calcium, magnesium, protein, ...) -- suppose you replace everything + control for bioavailability -- then you're fine? Then it becomes a search problem: find the mix of food with equivalent nutrients, adjusted for bioavailability of those nutrients. Or does milk have any more magic benefits?
